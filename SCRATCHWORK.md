# Scratchwork

There are a number of things that aren't great about this library in its current state:

* Dropdown and Portal have a lot of repeated code.
* Portal should be exported as PortalDropdown.
* The scrolling updates on the portal are no bueno.
* The fixed minimum height is no bueno.
* The default styles are too opinionated.
