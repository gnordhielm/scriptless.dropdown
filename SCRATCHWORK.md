# Scratchwork

There are a number of things that aren't great about this library in its current state:

* Dropdown and Portal have a lot of repeated code.
* Portal should be exported as PortalDropdown.
* The scrolling updates on the portal are no bueno.
* The fixed minimum height is no bueno.
* The default styles are too opinionated.
* I don't think that the dropdown needs to wrap that div around the trigger.
* Write full docs. Actually, find a fast way of making a nice docs site, like other libraries have.
